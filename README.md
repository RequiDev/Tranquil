# Tranquil theme for Replugged

## Prerequisites
- [Replugged](https://github.com/replugged-org/replugged#installation)

## Install

1. [Create a copy of this template](https://github.com/replugged-org/theme-template/generate)
2. Clone your new repository and cd into it
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm i`
4. Build the theme: `pnpm run build`
5. Reload Discord to load the theme

## Distribution

For theme distribution, Replugged uses bundled `.asar` files. Bundled themes can be installed to the
same theme folder as listed above.

## Troubleshooting

### Make sure Replugged is installed and running.

Open Discord settings and make sure the Replugged tab is there. If not,
[follow these instructions](https://github.com/replugged-org/replugged#installation) to install
Replugged.

### Make sure the theme is installed.

Check the [theme folder](https://github.com/replugged-org/replugged#installing-plugins-and-themes)
for your OS and make sure the theme is there. If not, make sure you have built the theme and that
the `NO_INSTALL` environment variable is not set.  
You can run `replugged.themes.list().then(console.log)` in the console to see a list of themes in
the theme folder.

## Original README

# Monster Themes
Need help with the themes? Visit the [Black Box](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb).

The Phoenix Bundle are forks of old themes that have ceased to be supported. Because I have been maintaining them for a year and have rewritten them to be more readable and efficient, I have renamed them and claimed them as my own.

The code itself is loads different but the output does still look the same.

Black Hole is an original theme that is easier to maintain.

All themes will be hopefully ported to BDv2 soon.
